    This app uses data from The Movie Database (TMDB) to find connections between actors through their movie collaborations.
    
    The "six degrees of separation" theory suggests that any two actors can be connected through no more than six links.
    
    ### How it works:
    1. Enter two actor names
    2. The app searches for movies they've appeared in
    3. It builds a network of actors and their connections
    4. It finds the shortest path between the two actors
    
    ### Note:
    - The search is limited to a depth of 2 to keep the response time reasonable
    - Only the top 5 most popular movies per actor are considered
